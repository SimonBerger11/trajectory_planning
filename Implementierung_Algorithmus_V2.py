# Functionality:
# Definitions of terminology:
# open_list: all not analysed but familiar nodes
# closed_list: all analysed nodes, which should not be analysed again
# 1. Add start_point to list open_list
# 2. Choose the node in the open_list with the lowest distance to the destination (Iteration 1: start_point)
# 3. Check if the current_point is the end_point
# yes: return the current point wiht all predecessors
# no: continue with 4 
# 4. Check on which ways the current point is located on the ways of the osm-file 
# 5. Find for each case the next point on the ways concerned, check if the point was already handled
# yes: dont handle it again
# 6. Handling of the points concerned: Calculation of the distance, Adding to a total distance, Setting the current point
# as predecessor and adding to the open_list
# 7. Continue with step 2
